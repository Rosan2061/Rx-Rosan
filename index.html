        <h2>DAD,</h2>
        <p>You mentioned something about Mommy, but you didn't say anything about yourself and Raju's wife. Why?</p>
        <p>You said Mommy did this and that, but you didn't explain why! Why not?</p>
        <p>Okay, fine. Mommy made a mistake, and she received the consequences for that mistake. But please, don't ask what punishment she received.</p>
        <p>It is because we couldn’t bear the constant torture that Mommy left the house.</p>
        <p>It’s been so many days since Mommy left the house, and you haven’t shown any concern. Fine, we don't care about your concern either.</p>
        <p>The truth is, we want to live with Mommy. If you had trusted us, after coming back and showing us your hand, you would have sent us to the porch, but Mommy wouldn't have been there. We had to swear on Mommy to tell the truth, which shows that you don’t trust us.</p>
        <p>If you wanted the property, you can have it. We don’t need a single piece of your property. We can support ourselves by earning, with Mommy's help.</p>
